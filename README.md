# Caustic-Image

Purpose: Create a freeform surface on a acrylic substrate to generate a hologram of a picture.

The original code and liteature are from Matt Ferraro, see here: https://mattferraro.dev/posts/caustics-engineering .
I have rewritten the code in Matlab. Additonally a .stl CAD format will be exported (instead of .obj)
